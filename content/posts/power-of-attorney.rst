.. note:: I am not a lawyer; this is not legal advice;
  please do not interpret this as legal advice.

I was recently told that a certain seller of an item I had purchased in NC would
not accept a power of attorney, and that I had no option but to fly across the
country to pick the item up in person.

This was disappointing to hear, because one of the main draws of this particular
item was it's proximity to family members that could go and pick it up on my
behalf.

I would have let the whole thing drop and just gotten a plane ticket, but the
seller wouldn't give a *reason* for why they would reject the power of attorney,
so I had to look into it myself.

.. note:: Also the seller hung up on me when I asked about it, which probably
  contributed.

The item in question was a vehicle, and by the state of North Carolina (and most
states) the buyer is required to sign the Bill of Sale and the Title. If you are
selling to a family member, it can be sufficient for the seller to sign the Bill
of Sale, then mail the forms and the "buyer" will sign them on their end. But
for a public auction site, they'll want the buyer and seller to both sign the
forms *before* handing over the vehicle, and that is easiest to do in person.

So: can a person with sufficient power of attorney sign for this forms and pick
up a vehicle won on a public auction site on my behalf?


What is power of attorney?
--------------------------

Generally speaking, power of attorney allows one person to act, legally, on
another person's behalf. This may be used to allow a trusted family member to
manage stateside affairs for a person overseas in the military. It may also be
to allow a trusted indivual to manage the estate and other property of an
elderly person who no longer wishes to do that themselves.


Important terms
---------------

- Agent: the person *with* power of attorney. They may act on behalf of the
  **principal**.
- Principal: the person *giving* power of attorney.


Purchasing a vehicle
--------------------

A sanity check: do people use power of attorney to buy vehicles?
It appears that they do! For example, nclamp.gov notes:

    You can use a special power of attorney to allow someone to do almost all
    legal actions that you can do yourself. Thus, for example, you could prepare
    a special power of attorney that lets your designated agent:

    1. Buy or sell *real* estate;
    2. **Purchase a car** [emphasis mine] or sell your furniture; [...]

My ability to execute (create, authorize) a power of attorney
-------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so it seems like it should be possible. Let's dive into the legislation.
NC power of attorney law is governed by the North Carolina Uniform Power of
Attorney Act (`NCUPOA`_). Several sections in this document are of interest to us.
The first is section 1-105, which describes what is necesary to create a valid
power of attorney.

.. _NCUPOA: https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByChapter/Chapter_32C.pdf

  ยง 32C-1-105. Execution of power of attorney.

  A power of attorney must be (i) signed by the principal [...] and (ii)
  acknowledged. A signature on a power of attorney is presumed to be genuine if
  the principal acknowledges the signature before a notary public or other
  individual authorized by law to take acknowledgements.

In other words, to create a power of attorney, I need to write it, sign it, and
have it notarized. Sounds do-able.


Meaning and effect
==================

I was concerned that there would be problems if I wrote and signed it in a state
that was *not* North Carolina: perhaps that would mean NC law would not apply.
However, the NC statute states that the "meaning and effect" of the power of
attorney is determined by the state that you indicate in your document. So, I
can simply say that the meaning and effect is for NC.

  ยง 32C-1-107. Meaning and effect of power of attorney.

  The meaning and effect of a power of attorney is determined by the law of the
  jurisdiction indicated in the power of attorney and, in the absence of an
  indication of jurisdiction, by the law of the jurisdiction in which the power
  of attorney was executed. (2017-153, s. 1.)

To accomodate this and ensure that these NC rules applied, regardless of where I
wrote/signed/notarized the document, I included this line in my power of
attorney document.

  MEANING AND EFFECT
  
  The meaning and effect of this power of attorney shall for all purposes be
  determined by the law of the State of North Carolina.


Liability for refusal to accept a power of attorney
----------------------------------------------------

Section 1-120 of the North Carolina Uniform Power of Attorney Act provides a
list of legitimate grounds for refusal, but I do not believe any of those would
apply here.

  ยง 32C-1-120. Liability for refusal to accept acknowledged power of attorney.
  [...]
  (c) A person is not required to accept an acknowledged power of attorney if any of the
  following circumstances exist:
  - [...]
  - [a list of circumstances that, to the best of my knowledge, do not apply here, regardless of ACS precedent or policy]


In addition, illegitimate refusal is specifically covered:
==========================================================

    (e) A person that refuses in violation of this section to accept an acknowledged
    power of attorney is subject to all of the following
    (1) A court order mandating acceptance of the power of attorney.
    (2) Liability for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in any action or
    proceeding that mandates acceptance of the power of attorney.
    (3) Any other remedy available under applicable law.


Conclusion
----------

So, it appears that a person able to use power of attorney to explicitly grant another person permission to act on their behalf.
While there are some caveats in the legislatino regarding things like health care decisions, it seems well suited
to handle buying a vehicle.
