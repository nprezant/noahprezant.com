.. warning:: I am not a lawyer; this is not legal advice;
  please do not interpret this as legal advice.

I recently purchased an vehicle on a public auction site, and was told that to
pick it up I had no option but to be there in person to sign the title and bill
of sale. Ordinarily I wouldn't mind, but it would have required flying and the
seller *also* required that I pick it up in less that 2 weeks. I also have
family members in the area who were willing to pick up the vehicle on my behalf.

I had heard that people will use "power of attorney" to delegate their authority
on specific (or general) legal matters -- things like running a business,
managing real property (like land), or managing tangible property (like a car)

I would have let the whole thing drop and just gotten a plane ticket, but the
seller wouldn't give a *reason* for why they would reject the power of attorney,
so I had to look into it myself.

.. note:: Also the seller hung up on me when I asked about it, providing
  additional motivation to look into it myself.

.. note:: North Carolina (and most states) requires that the buyer and seller
  sign the Bill of Sale and the Title when purchasing a vehicle.
  
  You don't have to sign at the same time. For example, when selling to a friend
  or family member, the seller could sign the Bill of Sale, mail the forms, and
  the buyer will sign them on their end.
  
  In this case it makes sense they wouldn't want to do that -- the public
  auction seller and I don't know each other, and they'll want both signatures
  *before* handing over the vehicle. That is easiest to do in person.

So: can I give a person sufficient power of attorney to sign these forms and
pick up the public auction vehicle on my behalf?


What is power of attorney?
##########################

Generally speaking, power of attorney allows one person to act, legally, on
another person's behalf. This may be used to allow a trusted family member to
manage stateside affairs for a person overseas in the military. It may also be
to allow a trusted indivual to manage the estate and/or other property of an
elderly person who no longer wishes to do that themselves.


Important terms
###############

- Agent: the person *with* power of attorney. They may act on behalf of the
  **principal**.
- Principal: the person *giving* power of attorney.


Purchasing a vehicle
####################

A sanity check: do people use power of attorney to buy vehicles?
It appears that they do! For example, nclamp.gov notes:

    You can use a special power of attorney to allow someone to do almost all
    legal actions that you can do yourself. Thus, for example, you could prepare
    a special power of attorney that lets your designated agent:

    1. Buy or sell *real* estate;
    2. **Purchase a car** [emphasis mine] or sell your furniture; [...]

My ability to execute (create, authorize) a power of attorney
#############################################################

Okay, so it should be possible. Let's dive into the legislation. NC power of
attorney law is governed by the **North Carolina Uniform Power of Attorney Act**
(`NCUPOA`_) enacted in 2018. Several sections in this document are of interest
to us. The first is section 1-105, which describes what is necesary to create a
valid power of attorney.

.. _NCUPOA: https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByChapter/Chapter_32C.pdf

  ยง 32C-1-105. Execution of power of attorney.

  A power of attorney must be (i) signed by the principal [...] and (ii)
  acknowledged. A signature on a power of attorney is presumed to be genuine if
  the principal acknowledges the signature before a notary public or other
  individual authorized by law to take acknowledgements.

In other words, to create a power of attorney, I need to write it, sign it, and
have it notarized. Sounds do-able.

Meaning and effect
==================

I was concerned that there would be problems if I wrote and signed it in a state
that was *not* North Carolina: perhaps that would mean NC law would not apply.
However, the NC statute states that the "meaning and effect" of the power of
attorney is determined by the state that you indicate in your document. So, I
can simply say that the meaning and effect is for NC.

  ยง 32C-1-107. Meaning and effect of power of attorney.

  The meaning and effect of a power of attorney is determined by the law of the
  jurisdiction indicated in the power of attorney and, in the absence of an
  indication of jurisdiction, by the law of the jurisdiction in which the power
  of attorney was executed. (2017-153, s. 1.)

To accomodate this and ensure that these NC rules applied, regardless of where I
wrote/signed/notarized the document, I included this line in my power of
attorney document.

  MEANING AND EFFECT
  
  The meaning and effect of this power of attorney shall for all purposes be
  determined by the law of the State of North Carolina.


Liability for refusal to accept a power of attorney
###################################################

Section 1-120 of the North Carolina Uniform Power of Attorney Act provides a
list of legitimate grounds for refusal, but I do not believe any of those would
apply here.

  ยง 32C-1-120. Liability for refusal to accept acknowledged power of attorney.
  [...]
  (c) A person is not required to accept an acknowledged power of attorney if any of the
  following circumstances exist:
  - [...]
  - [a list of circumstances that, to the best of my knowledge, do not apply here, regardless of ACS precedent or policy]


In addition, illegitimate refusal is specifically covered:
==========================================================

    (e) A person that refuses in violation of this section to accept an acknowledged
    power of attorney is subject to all of the following
    (1) A court order mandating acceptance of the power of attorney.
    (2) Liability for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in any action or
    proceeding that mandates acceptance of the power of attorney.
    (3) Any other remedy available under applicable law.


Conclusion
##########

So, it appears that a person able to use power of attorney to explicitly grant another person permission to act on their behalf.
While there are some caveats in the legislatino regarding things like health care decisions, it seems well suited
to handle buying a vehicle.
